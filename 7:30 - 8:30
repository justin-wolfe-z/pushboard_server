- Target 
- Switching to Slack web app in a pinned tab from desktop appâ€”hopefully allows for better focus. Also stopping myself from checking Slack while I wait for masquerade links to user Zaps to open.

- Code bug

Tuesday

- 1:1 with @jesse. We discussed performance, minimizing Slack distractions, 360 review prep, and I gave them a tour/demo of the API I've been working on.
